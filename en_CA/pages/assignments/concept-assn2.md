# CS2053 Game Programming Concept Assignment 2	

## Due: Tuesday March 14, 2023 @5PM

Answer the following questions related to chapters 5 and 6 of the textbook.

Write your answers inline in this file using markdown.

1. What is the difference between polling and event-based models of handling input (think of the steps in code that you would have to follow if you were implementing these models yourself)? 

2. The 4 values of “KeyState” defined in the textbook depend on both the state of keyboard in the last frame and the current frame. Describe a situation in game programming which definitely needs to use this 4-value key state, and a situation in game programming which only needs to depend on the current state of the keyboard. Also, for each of the following key states, give an example game action which needs to be triggered by that key state.
     - StillReleased
     - JustPressed
     - JustReleased
     - StillPressed

3. In a first-person 3D game, why do we always set the sound listener’s position to be the same as the camera? In third-person 3D games, what are advantages and problems when we set the sound listener’s position in the same location as the player object? Describe a situation in a third-person 3D game that, when the sound listener’s position is not properly set, the player object may hear a sound from the left, but the camera may view the sound emitter on the right (i.e., hear the sound from the right). 
 
4. For each of the following DSP effects, describe a game, which you played, you know, or you can imagine, that uses such an effect.

 	+ Reverb
 	+ Pitch shift
 	+ Compressor
 	+ Low-pass filter

5. Explain the difference between play mechanics, core mechanics, and local emergent gameplay. Give an example of each one.

6. Define and briefly explain the four parts of the Elemental Tetrad.

7. Give an example of a game genre where a large focus on story content would likely be well-received and one where it would likely be not well-received. Explain your reasoning.

8. A story has 4 main components. Define each component of the story, and describe how your project's story will provide all 4 aspects. 

9. In class, we discussed the concept of Flow. Briefly describe what flow is, and two side effects of being in a state of flow. Describe an example of how a game can attempt to provide flow to people of a wide range of skill levels.
