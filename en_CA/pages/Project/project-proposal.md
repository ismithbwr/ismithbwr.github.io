# CS2053 Project Proposal and Requirements
The course project focuses on game design and game programming. The following requirements must be adhered to, unless you have permission from the instructor.

 1. The project is team-based (teams must have 3-4 people). 
    + The game to be developed is a multi-level/scene game with 2N scenes/levels (where N is the number of teammates).
        
 2. The result of the project must be a complete, playable game with 6 or more levels or scenes, not including the start and end screens.

 3. The game should have a start (to introduce the game and authors) and end screen (for winning and/or losing). 
 
 4. The project and resulting game must include storytelling with audio or (on screen) text narration. This doesn't have to be a prominent part of the game, but should be represented somehow.
 
 5. The project and resulting game must include the following game programming technologies: 2D graphics (with animations) or 3D graphics, sound, physics, dynamic (or multiple) cameras, AI, and user interface (menu). 
    + For AI, you will create some game objects that have state-based behaviour and involve pathfinding.
    + For the AI requirement you can use those provided by Unity and/or write your own.
    + Don't worry too much about this for now, we will cover it in class later. There is a textbook chapter on the subject if you wish to get ahead of the curve though.

 6. The project must be developed using Unity version 2021.3.4f1
 7. Your game should be able to run successfully within the game editor and in a 16by9 aspect ratio. 

## Step 1. Team Members
### Due: February 10 @ 11:59
If you have created a team of 3-4 people (or at least a partial team of 2), submit your team member names by the deadline. 
Only one team member needs to submit the names, make sure you have full names in there or it will be confusing (e.g., we have 3 Isaacs in the course!). 
After the deadline, students who have not found a team will be randomly assigned into them.
