# CS2053 Project Repositories
For your course project, your group can create either a 3D or a 2D game. 
- You are welcome to manage the project however you wish, however the final product will need to be committed and pushed to a project repository. See below for links. 
- You have admin access on these repositories, so you may wish to add your team members and all work on one using git workflows.
- Only one team member should submit the final project. If you create multiple repositories, just tell me which one to go with.
